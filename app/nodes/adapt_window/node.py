"""LangGraph entry point for the adaptive-window node.

The node sits between ``diagnose`` and ``plan_actions`` on the
loop-back edge of the investigation pipeline. It runs ONLY when the
loop is continuing — terminal paths bypass it.

The actual decision logic lives in ``app.nodes.adapt_window.rules`` and
is imported here. Keeping the LangGraph wrapper thin means the rule can
be tested in isolation against plain dicts.
